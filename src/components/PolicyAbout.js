            <p>FindingCRE has developed a Commercial Real Estate listing platform that provides a cost effective way for Commerical Real Estate brokers to find and list properties.</p>
            <p>We have developed an inexpensive simple pricing plan that is fair to all.  There are no “extra fees” in order to get your listing to the “top”.  There are no contracts required and the first 30 days are always free!  Just pay for however long the listing is up over and beyond the initial 30 days.  No contract is required.  Just pay for what you use when you use it.</p>
